Every failure is a stepping stone to success
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts
Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently
Don't let failure stop you, let it inspire you
The only time you really fail is when you quit
It's not about how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up
Failure is the opportunity to do better next time
Keep your head high, your chin up, and keep moving forward
Failure is a detour, not a dead-end street
The only way to fail is to give up
Failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success
Every failure is a stepping stone to success
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts
The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows
Defeat is not the worst of failures. Not to have tried is the true failure
Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm
Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently
The only time you don't fail is the last time you try anything – and it works
Failure is the stepping stone to success
I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying
Love conquers all
Together we can do great things
Communication is the key to a healthy relationship
Trust is the foundation of every good relationship
A strong relationship requires two strong people
Distance means so little when someone means so much
Compromise is necessary in every relationship
The best relationships are the ones you never saw coming
Real love means growing together
Friendship is the foundation of a strong relationship
